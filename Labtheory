Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) Algorithm

The DDA algorithm is a simple and widely used method for rasterization of lines in computer graphics. It is a scan-conversion algorithm that generates points of a line at discrete intervals between the start and end points. The algorithm uses floating-point arithmetic to incrementally calculate intermediate points along the line based on its slope.

Algorithm Description

1. Input: Coordinates of the two endpoints of the line,  and .


2. Calculate differences:



\Delta x = x_1 - x_0, \quad \Delta y = y_1 - y_0

\text{steps} = \max(|\Delta x|, |\Delta y|)

4. Calculate increment values for each step:



X_{\text{inc}} = \frac{\Delta x}{\text{steps}}, \quad Y_{\text{inc}} = \frac{\Delta y}{\text{steps}}

x = x_0, \quad y = y_0

For each step, plot the pixel at 

Increment:


x = x + X_{\text{inc}}, \quad y = y + Y_{\text{inc}}

Characteristics

Produces smooth lines even for non-integer slopes.

Simple to implement but uses floating-point operations, which can be slower than integer-only algorithms like Bresenham’s line algorithm.

Works efficiently for lines with any slope.


Advantages

Easy to understand and implement.

Can be extended to draw curves and other shapes.


Disadvantages

Involves floating-point calculations.

Requires rounding operations at each step, which may introduce small computational errors
